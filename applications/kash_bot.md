<img width="656" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-19 at 16 55 07" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b96ff522-1b88-47ff-95ea-d23889eab0d6" />

- ### Name and one-liner of the project
  Kash - Your Friendly AI-Powered Prediction Markets Crypto Buddy On X
  
- ### Description
  Kash enables users to effortlessly place bets on the outcome of future events, directly from a simple X post. ElizaOS and Mira Network are used to digest market signals to create new trending markets and to perfectly     target the right X thread at the right time to ensure maximum user kick and engagement. Equally, Kash is building the first zkTLS <> AI oracle network to resolve markets immediately, in a decentralised and trustless manner -three of the biggest challenges stopping prediction markets from becoming the next big thing. At the core of Kash, there is Polkadot, to ensure millions of users deposit USDT on the biggest prediction markets, with Kash understanding and executing user intents from a simple post, automatically, fully effortlessly and seamlessly. **Before, PayPal changed the game with email-based payment systems. Today, Kash is redifining SocialFi with a simple post - poised for viral growth.** üß®

- ### Polkadot integration:
  Kash integrates seamlessly into Polkadot as a Substrate-based parachain, leveraging Polkadot‚Äôs shared security and XCM interoperability to enhance its AI-driven prediction markets. Built natively on Polkadot, Kash taps into Phala Network‚Äôs off-chain compute for its ElizaOS AI and aligns its zkTLS oracles and ZKML resolution with Polkadot‚Äôs zero-knowledge focus (e.g., JAM protocol). It can pull liquidity from Acala or data via Acurast, showcasing Polkadot‚Äôs flexibility for complex DeFi primitives. For Polkadot, Kash introduces a socially-driven use case‚Äîprediction markets with social media integration‚Äîboosting retail adoption, ecosystem liquidity, and technical innovation in AI and ZK domains - it effectively has the power to bring million of X users seamlessly onto Polkadot üôå
  
- ### Kash-team-fit:
  Kash is built upon two main pillars that the team profoundly believes in. Firstly, the unequivocal human right to permissionlessly participate in prediction markets to yield an accurate public good, and, secondly, the team's certainty and vision of the future of retail finance being fully embedded into social media and running on cryptorails. Finally, the team includes the nerdiest of cryptographers (zkp experts), blocklchain security hackers (DeFi focused) together with the most degen of crypto / web3 B2C marketers. The team further brings 7+ years of early-stage, product-led crypto entrepreneurial experience, with the best successful failures and vital lessons learned, all of which make us the hungriest to conquer the GTM with Kash üî•

### üîç Project Details

- ### Technology stack:
  Kash is a Substrate-based parachain built on the **Polkadot ecosystem**, harnessing shared security and **XCM** (cross-chain messaging) to drive its **AI-powered prediction markets**. Its off-chain AI framework, **ElizaOS**, runs on **Phala Network** with Intel SGX, enabling secure computation for market curation and resolution. Trustless operations are powered by **zkTLS oracles and a ZKML pipeline via RISC Zero‚Äôs zkVM**, aligning with Polkadot‚Äôs zero-knowledge vision (e.g., JAM protocol). Liquidity is sourced from **Acala‚Äôs aUSD stablecoin**, while **Acurast** delivers decentralized real-world data as oracles. The user experience is streamlined through a **Polkadot.js** frontend and custom APIs for social media integration, starting with X's API and moving later to Reddit, Telegam, Farecaster and more. 

- ### Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
  1. #### KashDAO Architecture Design
     ![kash_polka_architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/968706b8-663b-45f5-9aa9-b5ab04dfd0e0)
     The KashDAO architecture leverages Polkadot‚Äôs on‚Äëchain governance pallets (Democracy, Council, Technical Committee) alongside a bespoke Treasury & Buyback pallet to coordinate protocol funding, fee management, and token buy‚Äëbacks. Market parameters, pallet upgrades, and oracle lists are submitted as GOVERNANCE calls and voted on via on‚Äëchain referenda. Once approved, the Scheduler pallet enacts changes automatically at the next era boundary. Emergency multi‚Äësig interventions are handled by the Proxy pallet under a ‚ÄúCollective‚Äù proxy group, ensuring no single actor can unilaterally pause markets or alter critical modules. This design creates a fully decentralized decision loop‚Äîproposals originate in the community, are ratified on the Relay Chain, and executed atomically in the Kash parachain runtime.
  3. #### Protocol Architecture
     ![kash_aaa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d5c9788-92dc-4171-a1f5-22dfba8a448a)
     At its core, the Kash parachain runtime bundles three key pallets: the AMM pallet for on‚Äëchain constant‚Äëproduct markets, the Resolver pallet for trustless outcome settlement via zk‚Äëproof verification, and a ProxyAccount pallet for gas delegation and meta‚Äëtransactions. Off‚Äëchain, ElizaOS agents and Mira validators generate and curate markets, then submit XCM‚Äëencoded extrinsics to the parachain. Liquidity provisioning and swaps execute through an integrated DEX Aggregator pallet (e.g., HydraDX), while the FeeProxy pallet sponsors transaction fees, paid in xcUSD or KASH. MEV protection is provided by a dedicated bundle relayer that interfaces with collators‚Äîensuring private inclusion of large bets. Together, these modules stitch off‚Äëchain intelligence and on‚Äëchain execution into a seamless, Polkadot‚Äënative protocol.
  5. #### Listeners
     ![kash_wallet](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9f7fa15-1f80-4d79-9519-0c27d43a1e44)
     Kash off‚Äëchain listeners consist of two streams: the X Post Listener monitors public tweets tagging @kash_bot, parsing structured bet intents via a lightweight NLP layer; the DM Interface handles private commands, mapping natural‚Äëlanguage requests (‚ÄúBet 20 on NO‚Äù) into discrete extrinsic payloads. Both listeners sign payloads with a Privy‚Äëmanaged MPC key and forward them to a ProxyDispatcher service. This service batches incoming operations into a single ‚ÄúUserOperation‚Äù and routes them through the ProxyAccount pallet, enabling gas‚Äëabstracted execution. By decoupling social ingestion from on‚Äëchain calls, Kash maintains high throughput, resilience to social‚Äëlayer rate limits, and an immutable audit trail of user intents.
  7. #### Wallet & Account Logic
     ![kash_wallet_sequence](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44dce2d5-a9e4-43eb-9542-282458d5c401)
     Wallets are instantiated via the Privy MPC framework, which generates an SS58 address and splits key shares between the user device and Kash‚Äôs HSM. Each user gets a ProxyAccount on the parachain, controlled by a ‚Äúproxy‚Äù pallet instance. When a user action arrives, the Privy service reconstructs the signature locally, and the ProxyDispatcher submits the extrinsic through the ProxyAccount, which can both batch 0x‚Äëstyle swaps and AMM interactions. Fees are sponsored by the FeeProxy pallet, debited in xcUSD on success. In case of account compromise, users can rotate shares via an emergency recovery pallet, re-establishing control without exposing seed phrases‚Äîpreserving self‚Äëcustody and user experience.
  9. #### Automated, AI-Powered Market Creation
     ![kash_market_creation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4df5932d-f598-4be6-b9b0-b9a7a3640a6f)
     ElizaOS agents run in a distributed off‚Äëchain worker network, continuously scanning X for emerging topics. Upon detecting a suitable signal, the Market Creator agent uses a fine‚Äëtuned LLM to normalize the question, then computes a ‚ÄúGambling‚ÄëNeutral Behavioral Score‚Äù and consults Mira validators for consensus. If the score and validator attestations pass predefined thresholds, the agent submits an XCM‚Äëwrapped instantiate_market extrinsic to the parachain‚Äôs Factory pallet. That pallet spins up a new instance of the AMM and Resolver pallets, initializing liquidity pools and on‚Äëchain metadata. A feedback message is then sent back through @kash_bot, complete with initial odds‚Äîturning social chatter into decentralized markets in under seconds.

  
- ### Tokenomics and Token Utility Prior Research and Work For Community Engagement and Sustanability
  ![kash_tokenomics](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feb8680b-ee0f-4618-9e3e-2cef12e1dd55)

- ### [Demo mockup](https://youtu.be/2XzEAwKtLJ4)
  
- ### Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
  Core functionality is exposed via two complementary interfaces: (1) a lightweight REST/WebSocket API for off‚Äëchain agents and front‚Äëend bots, and (2) the on‚Äëchain RPC and extrinsic methods of our parachain.

In the off‚Äëchain API, each `UserOperation` object is modeled as:

```json
{
  "sender_ss58": "5F‚Ä¶",
  "calls": [
    {
      "pallet": "dexAgg",
      "method": "swap_exact_input",
      "args": {
        "asset_in": "DOT",
        "asset_out": "xcUSD",
        "amount_in": 1000000000000
      }
    },
    {
      "pallet": "amm",
      "method": "place_bet",
      "args": {
        "market_id": "0xabc123‚Ä¶",
        "outcome": 1,
        "amount": 50000000000
      }
    }
  ],
  "fee_asset": "xcUSD",
  "max_fee": 1000000000,
  "nonce": 42,
  "signature": "0x‚Ä¶"
}
```

The ProxyDispatcher packages this payload and dispatches it via the `proxy.dispatch` extrinsic.

On‚Äëchain, the runtime exposes pallets with the following key extrinsics (parameters simplified):

- **Factory.instantiate_market**  
  ```rust
  fn instantiate_market(
      origin: Origin, 
      question: Vec<u8>, 
      outcomes: u8, 
      deadline: T::BlockNumber
  ) -> MarketId
  ```
- **AMM.add_liquidity**  
  ```rust
  fn add_liquidity(
      origin: Origin, 
      market_id: MarketId, 
      amounts: Vec<Balance>
  )
  ```
- **AMM.place_bet**  
  ```rust
  fn place_bet(
      origin: Origin, 
      market_id: MarketId, 
      outcome: u8, 
      amount: Balance
  )
  ```
- **Resolver.resolve_market**  
  ```rust
  fn resolve_market(
      origin: Origin, 
      market_id: MarketId, 
      outcome: u8, 
      proof: Vec<u8>
  )
  ```
- **Treasury.withdraw_proceeds**  
  ```rust
  fn withdraw_proceeds(
      origin: Origin, 
      market_id: MarketId
  )
  ```

Market state is stored in a Rust struct:

```rust
struct MarketInfo<AccountId, Balance, BlockNumber> {
    question: Vec<u8>,
    creator: AccountId,
    outcomes: u8,
    reserves: Vec<Balance>,
    deadline: BlockNumber,
    resolved: bool,
    result: Option<u8>,
}
```

Resolution proofs are verified by the on‚Äëchain `Verifier` pallet using a succinct SNARK verifying key. Events such as `MarketCreated`, `BetPlaced`, `MarketResolved`, and `PayoutIssued` provide real‚Äëtime feeds to off‚Äëchain indexers. Cross‚Äëchain asset transfers and XCM‚Äëwrapped extrinsics enable multi‚Äënetwork interoperability for both liquidity and resolution agents.
  
- ### What our project is **not** or **will not** provide in this grant
  In this three‚Äëmonth fast grant we will **not** deploy a full production parachain, build a user‚Äëfacing trading UI, or finalize tokenomics and governance flows. Our scope is limited to delivering comprehensive technical documentation and prototypes for (1) smart‚Äëcontract driven automated market creation, (2) an advanced zkTLS‚áÑAI oracle network ensuring off‚Äëchain site integrity and uptime, and (3) an in‚Äëhouse Polkadot ‚ÄúPrivy‚Äù module using threshold cryptography for social‚Äëlogin account creation. Everything beyond these core R&D efforts‚Äîend‚Äëto‚Äëend parachain integration, performance tuning to >1,000¬†TPS, cross‚Äëchain asset bridges, mobile SDKs, compliance/KYC layers, full audit and security hardening‚Äîwill be scheduled for the subsequent project phase, outside the grant‚Äôs timeline.  

### üëΩ User Acquisition Strategy and Execution

![pre-launch-image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbd0a2e7-c659-4adb-8bac-acb1341fbe72)

Kash‚Äôs go-to-market strategy is engineered to acquire a massive user base by turning social engagement into a high-stakes, reward-driven game. During pre-launch, Kash runs a multi-season, Simpsons-themed gamified farming campaign that transforms social media activity‚Äîmemes, predictions, riddles, referrals‚Äîinto a viral quest for $KASH tokens and exclusive NFT status. With influencer seeding (50‚Äì100 KOLs), auto-generated visual bet tweets, and a mystery-driven finale, the campaign is structured to pull in hundreds of thousands of users across X, Farcaster, and Discord. Scarcity via invite-only beta, constant leaderboard reshuffles, and casino-style psychological hooks (like variable rewards and near-miss messaging) ensure participants don‚Äôt just join‚Äîthey obsessively compete, share, and climb. Every social interaction becomes a growth node in a self-reinforcing flywheel.

![post_launch_image_kash](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7927cb47-4add-4819-a866-38d1c77c9b5a)

Post-launch, Kash rapidly activates these primed users by leveraging viral loops, real-time trend hijacking, and creator-driven market seeding. Launch is synced with a high-profile cultural event to ensure visibility, with influencers posting their bets in real-time, creating shareable content for immediate network effects. Paid ads, real-world visibility (like London bus campaigns), and integrations with platforms like Discord and Farcaster expand the reach beyond crypto Twitter. To drive conversion and long-term retention, the strategy layers in token yield mechanics, exclusive memberships, gamified betting incentives, and governance-lite perks‚Äîturning every user into a stakeholder. In short, Kash doesn‚Äôt just market‚Äîit builds a movement fueled by memes, money, and mass virality, making client acquisition a matter of momentum, not speculation.

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

Kash positions itself as a high‚Äëimpact Polkadot parachain, combining decentralized prediction markets (CPAMM), advanced zkTLS‚áÑAI oracle technology, and seamless social‚Äëlogin onboarding. By integrating AI‚Äëcurated markets with on‚Äëchain composability and Substrate‚Äënative pallet design, Kash not only enriches DeFi and oracle capabilities on Polkadot but also unlocks a massive user base from social platforms (X, Farecaster, Reddit).

### Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?  
Kash ships as a dedicated parachain runtime composed of custom pallets for MarketFactory, AMM, Resolver and ProxyAccount. It leverages Polkadot‚Äôs cross‚Äëchain messaging (XCM) to integrate off‚Äëchain AI agents (ElizaOS) and Mira consensus for automated market creation, and embeds a zkTLS oracle pallet for trustless outcome verification. FeeProxy and DEX‚ÄëAggregator pallets (e.g. HydraDX) handle gas sponsorship and in‚Äëchain swaps, while Relay Chain governance (Democracy, Treasury) oversees protocol upgrades and buy‚Äëbacks.

### Target audience 

- **Retail bettors & social traders** on X, Farecaster, Reddit, Telegram, Discord, among others!
‚Äîany user can create or join markets via simple social posts. Our first, initial ICP is anyone 25-35 years-old, crypto degen, previously partcipated in social bets or SocialFi apps and is tech savvy (enough to have a crypto wallet). As per some gaming psychological customer profiling, this sort of user could be consider a "gambler". 
- **DeFi investors** seeking new on‚Äëchain yield opportunities with dynamic fee/reward models. As per some gaming psychological customer profiling, this sort of user could be consider a "saver" or "sophisticated investor"

### What need(s) does your project meet?  
- **Mass onboarding**: social‚Äëlogin via Privy‚ÄëMPC lowers UX barriers, bringing millions of non‚Äëcrypto users to Polkadot.  
- **Automated, decentralized market creation**: AI‚Äëdriven question structuring and on‚Äëchain Factory instantiation scales prediction markets beyond manual provisioning.  
- **Trustless resolution**: zkTLS proofs + ezkl‚Äëcompiled AI inference deliver cryptographically verifiable outcomes without centralized oracles.  
- **Composable infra**: other parachains can leverage Kash‚Äôs oracle and AMM pallets to bootstrap their own markets or extend existing DeFi apps.

### Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?  
- **PolkaOracle** offers a general oracle network on Polkadot, but lacks integrated zkTLS proofs and AI inference pipelines
- **Polkadex** is a parachain DEX focused on order‚Äëbook trading; it doesn‚Äôt provide prediction markets or AI‚Äëdriven oracles

**How is Kash different?**  
- **End‚Äëto‚Äëend zkTLS‚áÑAI oracle** built into the runtime, not just data feeds. The first, automated, decentralised, immediate and trustless prediction market resolution oracle network. 
- **Automated market creation** by off‚Äëchain AI agents, not manual proposals, through ElizaOS and Polkadot integration, at the cutting-edge of advanced agentic AI models. 
- **Social‚Äëfirst UX** with threshold‚Äëcryptography login, onboarding via existing social identities.
- **Kash is to Polkadot what PayPal was to e-commerce** by setting a precedent and first-mover-advantage when it comes to fully embedding prediction markets into social media. 

**If no direct analogue exists, why?**  
Prediction markets with integrated AI+zk proofs and social login are a novel convergence of SocialFi, AI‚Äëoracles, and DeFi‚Äîareas still nascent on Polkadot. Kash pioneers this combination, filling a clear gap in the ecosystem.

## üîÆ Future Plans

### Continued Development Post‚ÄìFast Grant
Once the core POC is delivered, Kash will move into a 3‚Äì4¬†month MVP phase focused on:  
1. **GTM & Farming Launch** ‚Äì Deploy gamified ‚Äúfarm‚Äëto‚Äëfish‚Äù SocialFi campaigns to onboard savers and gamblers via token‚Äëincentivized yield farms, in partnership with top crypto B2C agencies (ex‚ÄëCoinbase, Lido, Uniswap teams).  
2. **MVP Feature Build‚Äëout** ‚Äì Harden and extend the oracle network to handle multiple data sources, add multi‚Äëchoice markets, and integrate front‚Äëend UIs for X/Discord.  
3. **Community Engagement** ‚Äì Coordinate Discord ‚Äúfeed ambassador‚Äù contests, X‚Äëbased referral campaigns, and leaderboard competitions to lock in a loyal user base and drive viral adoption.

### Additional Funding Plans
- **Pre‚ÄëSeed VC & Angels** ‚Äì We will secure angel checks and are in advanced discussions with tier‚Äëone VCs for a pre‚Äëseed round.  
- **Grants & Ecosystem Programs** ‚Äì We will apply for Polkadot ecosystem grants (beyond Fast‚ÄëGrant) and pursue relevant accelerator support.  
- **Strategic Partnerships** ‚Äì Engage DAOs, DeFi protocols, and prediction‚Äëmarket infrastructure projects for co‚Äëmarketing and potential co‚Äëfunding.

### Vision & Ecosystem Impact
Kash aims to become the world‚Äôs largest, highest‚Äëfrequency prediction platform‚Äîfully embedded in social media and powered by trustless zk‚Äëproof oracles and AI agents. By leveraging Polkadot‚Äôs scalability and cross‚Äëchain messaging, we will:  
- **Double‚ÄëDown on Adoption** ‚Äì Simplify market creation & resolution to attract millions of X, Farecaster, and Reddit users.  
- **Enable Reusable Oracle Infrastructure** ‚Äì Open‚Äësource our zkTLS‚áÑAI oracle stack so other DApps can tap into provably‚Äëfair off‚Äëchain data.  
- **Drive Native DeFi Growth** ‚Äì Fuse prediction markets with yield‚Äëbearing strategies to convert ‚Äúsavers‚Äù into active participants and bootstrap deep liquidity.  
- **Catalyze SocialFi on Polkadot** ‚Äì Showcase how Polkadot‚Äôs security and governance can underpin truly trustless, socially‚Äëdriven financial products at scale.  


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

Beyond the technical team, Kash has secured founding members from tier-one web3 crypto protocols, from legal to design to hard core cryptographics experts, as the project's success relies on the correct GTM, development, execution and user adoption, maximising our chances. 

Remember that the Fast-Grants Programme is designed as a first step for promising projects. We're looking for projects that can continue to grow beyond this initial funding.
