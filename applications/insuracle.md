# 📝 Name of your Project

## 🌟 Project Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tagline (one sentence summary)

  Insuracle provides parametric insurance with policies and payments enabled by smart contracts

- A brief description of your project

  (Idea only) Parametric insurance which based on simple verifiable inputs like how many inches of flood water, how many stolen credit cards for sale on DarkNet.  And this        model finally allows insurance to be formalised into smart contacts. We’ll take data from APIs to decentralised oracles, which will supply smart contracts.

- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Polkadot

  Resilience is the number one requirement in insurance. And decentralisation will kill the greedy intermediaries. Polkadot is great for providing the required resilience for our product.

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project

  Both of us being serial entrepreneurs, we very much enjoy problem solving, and the insurance market is long overdue some heavy disruption. We realised that implementation of Insuracle will be revolutionary for the insurance industry.

- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality

  Core data entities (Policy, ClaimEvent) conceptually defined. Detailed specifications and API definitions are planned for development milestones.
  
- What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement

  Not a traditional underwriter or holder of traditional reserves.
Does not cover non-parametric or subjective claims.
Will initially focus on specific, high-reliability data use cases (e.g. cyber attack, fire, flood).
Does not build proprietary oracle networks or act as a primary data source.

  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and clarify any limitations

### 🧩 Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

  Insuracle fits within the DeFi sector of the Polkadot ecosystem. It will function as an application layer, deploying smart contracts on a suitable parachain (e.g., Astar, Moonbeam, or potentially others) to utilize Polkadot's shared security, interoperability, and resilience. It leverages essential ecosystem components like smart contract platforms and oracle integrations (e.g., Chainlink, Acurast) to bring real-world risk management on-chain.
  
- Who is your target audience?

  Individuals and communities seeking transparent, automated coverage for specific parametric risks (initially flood) often underserved by traditional insurance.
Small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) needing efficient coverage against quantifiable cyber threats (like data breaches detected via dark web monitoring).
Web3 users and DeFi participants looking for innovative, blockchain-native risk management solutions.

- What need(s) does your project meet?

Insuracle addresses the needs for:
  Transparency & Efficiency: Replacing complex, costly traditional insurance processes with clear, automated smart contract logic.
Speed & Reliability: Enabling near-instant payouts automatically triggered by verified oracle data, removing human delays and disputes.
Accessibility & New Markets: Offering coverage for specific, parametric risks that may be difficult or expensive to insure traditionally.
Reduced Counterparty Risk: Minimizing reliance on intermediaries through trust-minimized smart contract execution.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?

  Broader DeFi insurance space exists (with multi-chain projects like Neptune Mutual focusing on parametric cover for DeFi risks, or aggregators), but our research indicates no active, dedicated projects focusing specifically on parametric insurance for real-world events like flood and data breaches, built natively within the Polkadot ecosystem. Some projects like PolkaInsure were conceptualized previously, but their current status or exact model differs.
  
  - If so, how is your project different?
 
    Insuracle differentiates itself from existing broader DeFi insurance protocols by:

Focusing exclusively on parametric triggers linked to verifiable, objective real-world data feeds (not subjective claims assessment or solely DeFi-related risks like smart contract exploits).

  - If not, why might such a project not exist yet?
 
    Polkadot's development initially emphasized core infrastructure, interoperability solutions, and foundational DeFi primitives (like DEXs and lending), potentially delaying the emergence of more specialized application layers like niche insurance.

> **Note**: We prioritize projects building on Plaza/Polkadot Hub, games, and DeFi applications, though all types of projects will be considered.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | MIT |
| 0b. | Documentation |We will provide inline code documentation explaining key functions and logic. Additionally, a basic tutorial will guide users on setting up a local development environment, deploying the smart contracts to a testnet, and interacting with the core functions (policy creation, status check) via the frontend dApp or command line. |
| 0c. | Testing and Testing Guide | Core smart contract functions (policy creation, state changes, premium handling, trigger logic, payout) will be covered by comprehensive unit tests (e.g., using Hardhat/Foundry or cargo test depending on language). The guide will detail how to execute these tests and interpret the results. |
| 0d. | Article | We will publish an article (e.g., on Medium or a project blog) summarizing the Insuracle concept, the work completed during the grant (Milestones 1 & 2 achievements), the MVP functionalities, and outlining our future plans for the project within the Polkadot ecosystem. |
| 1. | Core Contracts (MVP) | Development, testing, and documentation of the core smart contracts (likely Solidity or ink!) for the Cyber Breach insurance product. Includes: Policy creation logic (asset monitored, coverage amount, trigger threshold), basic premium acceptance, state management (Active, Expired), and internal logic for handling oracle data (initially mocked). Verification: Deployed contracts on specified testnet, GitHub repo with documented code, successful execution report of unit tests covering core logic. |
| 2. | Basic Frontend dApp | A minimal web interface (e.g., React) enabling users to: connect a Polkadot{.js} compatible wallet, input policy parameters (asset, coverage, trigger), see a mock premium, deploy a policy to the testnet contract, and view their active policies associated with their wallet. Verification: Link to the live dApp hosted (e.g., IPFS/Vercel), GitHub repo, screencast demonstrating user flow on testnet. |
| 3. | Oracle Integration & Payout | Integrate a chosen oracle service (e.g., Acurast, Chainlink) on testnet to receive mock/test data simulating dark web breach record counts. Implement smart contract logic to process oracle data, compare against policy trigger threshold, update policy state (e.g., Triggered, PaidOut), and execute automated payouts of testnet tokens. Update frontend to reflect these status changes. Verification: Updated contracts on testnet, GitHub repo, screencast showing end-to-end flow (policy creation -> mock trigger via oracle -> status change -> testnet token payout). |
